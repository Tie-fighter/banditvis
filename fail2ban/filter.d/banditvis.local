# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the password failures messages in the logfile. The
#          host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
#          be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>\S+)
# Values:  TEXT
#

# Count all bans in the logfile
failregex = fail2ban.actions: WARNING \[(.*)\] Ban <HOST>

# Option:  ignoreregex
# Notes.:  regex to ignore. If this regex matches, the line is ignored.
# Values:  TEXT
#

# Ignore our own bans, to keep our counts exact.
# In your config, name your jail 'fail2ban', or change this line!
ignoreregex = fail2ban.actions: WARNING \[banditvis\] Ban <HOST>
